				<p> We source the freshest, finest ingredients available—from Maryland produced milk and cream, to the highest quality imported flavorings—and take pride in combining them by hand, one gallon at a time, on site.</p>

				<p> Victor, our founder, grew up in Edinburgh, Scotland and lived above an Italian ice cream parlor, Mr. Boni’s, that dated back to 1907. He began working there at age 15 and later became the production and facility manager—the only person outside of the family bloodline to learn the secret family ice cream recipes.</p>

				<p> Since those humble beginnings, Victor and Susan’s team has grown, but the recipe has stayed the same. Locals have voted our ice cream the “Best Ice Cream on the Eastern Shore” for 10 years in a row! Our reviews and ratings on Google, TripAdvisor, Facebook and Yelp are beyond reproach, and, more importantly, the smiles at our window leave us feeling like Santa Claus every day. That’s how we know we’re doing something right! </p>
